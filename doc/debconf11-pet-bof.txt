Package Entropy Tracker
--------------------------

Current version:
  git://git.debian.org/pet/pet3.git
  #pet-devel, pet-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org

  http://pet.debian.net/pkg-perl/pet.cgi

  written in Python using PostgreSQL

  supports Git and Subversion

Current users:
  PET3: pkg-perl
  PET2: pkg-games, pkg-haskell, pkg-multimedia, pkg-ruby-extras
  PET1: debian-med, pkg-java, python-apps, debian-edu, pkg-voip python-modules (wagner), more on http://pet.alioth.debian.org/ (probably terribly outdated)

  All should be switched to PET3 in the near feature (needs some more code changes).

Ideas for the future:
 - Support other SVN layout (package/{trunk,branches,tags})
 - Show bug reports from Ubuntu (optionally)
 - Track package status in stable
 - Move PET to Alioth
   - Track package status via projectb?
 - Import repository information into UDD (lucas, tille (for blends overview))
 - RSS feeds (for different categories/parameters; ready-for-upload and RC buggy being the most interesting ones)
 - Add support for darcs (for pkg-haskell)
 - IRC/Mail reminders

Distribution-wide PET?
- needs commit hooks (for interested teams)
- or cronned and finding repo info from Vcs-* header
